#CLI, git and markdown

## Why?

This is repository part of a [https://www.codeinstitute.net] (Code Institute) lesson that teaches about using the Comman Line Interface (CLI) in relation to [https://www.github.com] (GitHub). Web developers can upload their work to github so prospective employers can review and inspect your capabilites and get a feel for how you work and your ambitions in regard to web development.

Code Institute uses github as a way to access your projects and can also offer assistance mid-project if you get stuck as an alternative to receiving countless emails full of project files, as github is a cloud based service it can be updated as necessary.

## How?

Using commands from your IDE's terminal window you can add, remove, modify and store files as you wish.

## What's next?

That's it for now with this particular project. On to the next section of the course!

## Anything Else?

Not really, just a picture of my mum's cat so I could have a go at adding an image using mark down.
